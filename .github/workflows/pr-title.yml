name: Lint PR Title

# Validate that PR titles follow Conventional Commits format.
# Since we squash merge PRs, the PR title becomes the merge commit message,
# which Python Semantic Release uses to determine version bumps.
#
# This avoids burdening external contributors with conventional commit enforcement
# on every individual commit. See: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
#
# NOTE: pull_request_target is used instead of pull_request because it runs in the
# context of the base branch and has reliable access to the GITHUB_TOKEN for reading
# PR metadata.
