Getting multiple objects
===============
**Getting multiple objects**

The recipes in this following section address how to query the dataset for multiple objects.

&#9888; When working with queries to return objects based on a set of characteristics, it is likely that you'll end up with a few objects which are no longer maintained by ATT&CK. These are objects marked as deprecated or revoked. We keep these outdated objects around so that workflows depending on them don't break, but we recommend you avoid using them when possible. Please see the section [Working with deprecated and revoked objects](#Working-with-deprecated-and-revoked-objects) for more information.
