Stix Recipes
===============

**Python recipes**

Below are example python recipes which can be used to work with ATT&CK data. They assume the existence of an object implementing the DataStore API. Any of the methods outlined in the [Accessing ATT&CK data in python](#accessing-ATTCK-Data-in-Python) section should provide an object implementing this API.

This section utilizes the [stix2 python library](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-python-stix2). Please refer to the [STIX2 Python API Documentation](https://stix2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information on how to work with STIX programmatically. See also the section on [Requirements and imports](#requirements-and-imports).

**Getting an object**

The recipes in this section address how to query the dataset for a single object.
