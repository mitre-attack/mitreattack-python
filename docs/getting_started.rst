Getting started
==============================================

This repository houses the ATT&CK catalog's Cyber Threat Intelligence, represented in the STIX 2.0 JSON format. 
Additionally, it includes a USAGE document that provides further examples for accessing and parsing our dataset using Python.

Install
-----

To use this package, install the mitreattack-python library with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ :

.. code:: bash

   pip install mitreattack-python


Note: the library requires `python3 <https://www.python.org/>`_.

MitreAttackData Library
------------------------

The ``MitreAttackData`` library is used to read in and work with MITRE ATT&CK STIX 2.0 content. This library provides 
the ability to query the dataset for objects and their related objects. This is the main content of mitreattack-python;
you can read more about other modules in this library under the "Additional Modules" header in the side pane.

Additional Modules

   * - module
     - description
     - documentation
   * - `navlayers <https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/tree/master/mitreattack/navlayers>`_
     -  A collection of utilities for working with `ATT&CK Navigator <https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-navigator>`_ layers. Provides the ability to import, export, and manipulate layers. Layers can be read in from the filesystem or python dictionaries, combined and edited, and then exported to excel or SVG images.
     -  Further documentation can be found `here <https://mitreattack-python.readthedocs.io/en/126-docs-add-section-to-docs-for-accessing-stix/navlayers.html>`_ 
   * - `attackToExcel <https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/tree/master/mitreattack/attackToExcel>`_
     - A collection of utilities for converting `ATT&CK STIX data <https://github.com/mitre/cti>`_ to Excel spreadsheets. It also provides access to `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ DataFrames representing the dataset for use in data analysis. 
     - Further documentation can be found `here <https://mitreattack-python.readthedocs.io/en/126-docs-add-section-to-docs-for-accessing-stix/attacktoexcel.html>`_
   * - `collections <https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/tree/master/mitreattack/collections>`_
     - A set of utilities for working with `ATT&CK Collections and Collection Indexes <https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend/blob/master/docs/collections.md>`_. Provides functionalities for converting and summarizing data in collections and collection indexes, as well as generating a collection from a raw stix bundle input. 
     - Further documentation can be found `here <https://mitreattack-python.readthedocs.io/en/126-docs-add-section-to-docs-for-accessing-stix/collections.html>`_.
   * - `diffStix <https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/tree/master/mitreattack/diffStix>`_
     -   Create markdown, HTML, JSON and/or ATT&CK Navigator layers reporting on the changes between two versions of the STIX2 bundles representing the ATT&CK content. Run ``diff_stix -h`` for full usage instructions.
