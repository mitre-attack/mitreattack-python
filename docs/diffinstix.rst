.. code:: bash

  # You must run `pip install mitreattack-python` in order to access the diff_stix command
    diff_stix --help
    usage: diff_stix [-h] [--old OLD] [--new NEW] [--domains {enterprise-attack,mobile-attack,ics-attack} [{enterprise-attack,mobile-attack,ics-attack} ...]] [--markdown-file MARKDOWN_FILE] [--html-file         HTML_FILE] [--html-file-detailed HTML_FILE_DETAILED]

    Create changelog reports on the differences between two versions of the ATT&CK content. Takes STIX bundles as input. For default operation, put enterprise-attack.json, mobile-attack.json, and ics-attack.json bundles in 'old' and 'new' folders for the script to compare.

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Changelog JSON format
-----

The changelog helper script has the option to output a JSON file with detailed differences between ATT&CK releases.
This is the overall structure you can expect to find in the file.
A brief explanation of key pieces can be found below.

.. code-block:: json
  {
    "enterprise-attack": {
      "techniques": {
          "additions": [],
          "major_version_changes": [],
          "minor_version_changes": [],
          "other_version_changes": [],
          "patches": [],
          "revocations": [],
          "deprecations": [],
          "deletions": [],
      },
      "software": {},
      "groups": {},
      "campaigns": {},
      "mitigations": {},
      "datasources": {},
      "datacomponents": {}
    },
    "mobile-attack": {},
    "ics-attack": {},
    "new-contributors": [
      "Contributor A",
      "Contributor B",
      "Contributor C"
    ]
  }


* The top-level objects include information about specific domains as well as ``new-contributors``, which are only found in the newer ATT&CK release.
* For domain changes, they are broken down by object type, e.g. ``techniques`` or ``mitigations``.
* The following table helps break down the change types that are currently tracked.

.. list-table:: Title
   :widths: 33 33 34
   :header-rows: 1

   * - field 
     - type
     - description
   * - ``additions``    
     -array[object]
     - ATT&CK objects which are only present in the new STIX data.      
   * - ``major_version_changes``
     - array[object]
     - ATT&CK objects that have a major version change. (e.g. 1.0 → 2.0). 
   * - ``minor_version_changes``
     - array[object]
     - ATT&CK objects that have a minor version change. (e.g. 1.0 → 1.1).  
   * - ``other_version_changes``
     - array[object]
     - array[object] | ATT&CK objects that have a version change of any other kind. (e.g. 1.0 → 1.3). These are unintended, but can be found in previous releases.
     * - ``patches``
     - array[object]
     - ATT&CK objects that have been patched while keeping the version the same.  
      * - ``revocations`` 
     - array[object]
     - ATT&CK objects which are revoked by a different object. 
   * - ``deprecations``  
     - array[object]
     - ATT&CK objects which are deprecated and no longer in use, and not replaced.   
   * - ``deletions``    
     - array[object
     - ATT&CK objects which are no longer found in the STIX data. This should almost never happen.     


Changed Objects
-----

The bulk of the changelog file consists of lists of JSON objects.
If you are familiar with reading the STIX format, they may look famliar, yet a little "off".
That is because there are a few fields that have been added in some cases depending on what section they appear in.
For example, objects that are brand new do not have ``previous_version`` available to them.
The following table lists the extra fields that can be found in objects in the changelog.

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 25 25 25 25
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Field
     - Required
     - Type
     - Description
   * - ``changelog_mitigations`` 
     - false
     - object 
     - Three lists for ``shared``, ``new``, and ``dropped`` for Mitigations that are related to a Technique between versions.      
   * - ``changelog_detections`` 
     - false
     - object 
     - HTML rendering of a table that displays the differences between descriptions for an ATT&CK object.        
   * - ``detailed_diff`` 
     - false
     - string 
     - A python DeepDiff object that has been JSON serialized which represents STIX changes for an ATT&CK object between releases.        
   * - ``previous_version``
     - false
     - string 
     - If the object existed in the previous release, then it denotes the version the object was in the previous release.    
   * - ``version_change``  
     - false
     - string 
     - If the object existed in the previous release and was changed in the current release, then a descriptive string in the format '``old-version`` → ``new-version``'
