Tactics by matrix
===============

The tactics are individual objects (``x-mitre-tactic``), and their order in a matrix a (``x-mitre-matrix``) is
found within the ``tactic_refs`` property in a matrix. The order of the tactics in that list matches
the ordering of the tactics in that matrix. The following recipe returns a structured list of tactics within each matrix of the input DataStore.

.. code-block:: python
    
    from stix2 import Filter

    def getTacticsByMatrix(thesrc):
        tactics = {}
        matrix = thesrc.query([
            Filter('type', '=', 'x-mitre-matrix'),
        ])
        
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            tactics[matrix[i]['name']] = []
            for tactic_id in matrix[i]['tactic_refs']:
                tactics[matrix[i]['name']].append(thesrc.get(tactic_id))
        
        return tactics

    # get tactic layout
    getTacticsByMatrix(src)
