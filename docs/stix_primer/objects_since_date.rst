Objects created or modified since a given date
===============

Sometimes you may want to get a list of objects which have been created or modified after a certain time.

.. code-block:: python
    
    from stix2 import Filter

    def get_created_after(thesrc, timestamp):
        filt = [
            Filter('created', '>', timestamp)
        ]
        return thesrc.query(filt)

    get_created_after(src, "2018-10-01T00:14:20.652Z")


    def get_modified_after(thesrc, timestamp):
        filt = [
            Filter('modified', '>', timestamp)
        ]
        return thesrc.query(filt)
        
    get_modified_after(src, "2018-10-01T00:14:20.652Z")


We don't recommend you use this method to detect a change to the contents of the knowledge base. For detecting an update to the overall knowledge base we recommend using requests to `check the list of released versions of ATT&CK <https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md#access-a-specific-version-of-attck>`_ .
